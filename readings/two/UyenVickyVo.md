## Way Of Seeing  
### John Berger / Ways of Seeing (1972)



Berger started the documentary mentioning that *"Perspective makes the eye the center of the invisible world"*. Painting and art, as we look at it, we focus on one thing at a time. However; things changed when the camera came into play. According to Berger, the camera is a freeform that can capture the most complex combination. The idea is that the camera has changed the way we see things and how we see it; allowing us to see things from a different perspective and angle. 

In the old days, artworks can only be seen exclusively from the place that displayed it. Berger used Botticelli Venus and Mars as an example. Now, with the reproduction of the paintings, it allows us to view the artwork anywhere in the world, especially in the digital age, we can see any painting within a few clicks on google search. We can view it anywhere, in the context of our own lives and the uniqueness is somewhat lost. I agree with Berger's statement, 
>*"Its uniqueness is part of the uniqueness of the single place where it is. Everything around it confirms and consolidates around it"*  

but now, paintings belong to no place. 

This idea and concept apply to technology today. We can be easily accessible to anything, not just art. Some of the uniqueness and meaning behind the art is lost during the transition. Not just the art itself, but also in the context, the color, the texture. Nothing will ever replace the original piece. This part of the documentary reminds me of the time I was young in Forever 21, I've seen some of the $12 t-shirts that have some famous Renaissance-looking type of painting on it. Sometimes I wonder, where do the actual painting come from? The painting looks like it would be millions of dollars in value and must carry such deep meaning behind it, but now, it's being printed on a $12 t-shirt. Technology is great in some aspects, but for this particular aspect, in my opinion, it's something that downgrades the value of art. *"The images come to you, you do not go to them"*. True, the painting came to me in Forever 21, I did not go to Rome for it. It's pretty sad.

I agree that artwork always played a role in the demonstration of power and prestige. However; at this current time; I believe the concept has shifted. The money value is somewhat on the heavier side compares to the actual value of the piece. What I meant is that you could own a 5 million dollars painting, but since the digital world has come into play, the understanding of traditional arts is being lost, anything is accessible, it won't be seen as a valuable thing to someone. But if you take a picture, announce it on Instagram that you just bought this 5 million dollar painting. Now, the cost of the painting just gives you power and prestige. You could go viral with just that. 

A few years ago, when Snapchat first came out, they rolled out a few different filters that overlay on your phone camera. The dog filter is one of the most famous ones. I remember seeing [Mona Lisa in Snapchat's Dog Filter](https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.451066260.4889/flat,800x800,070,f.jpg). I was lost for word a little bit; especially after I found out that I can buy this on Redbubble as a poster for $20, or $52 (with frame) on Amazon. After a few minutes of researching, it seems like Mona Lisa, one of the most valuable pieces of art in the history, is now part of a viral thing called "Mona Lisa Snapchat Filters" memes. The most famous, most important, most phenomenal piece of artwork on the planet, the universe, is totally lost in transition, thanks to Social Media.

On another point Berger brought up about how classical European painting has shaped the way women see themselves. I can relate and personally I think it's going even more downhill nowadays in this current age. From the document, one of the lady expressed that  
>*"Classical European painting has shaped that image. In my own case, I find it quite impossible when I look at the paintings that you show in your film, I can't take them seriously. I cannot identify with them because they are so immensely exaggerated always you know they fasten onto some secondary sexual characteristics almost breasts and sort of great big bee sting bottoms you know and those huge things like that and they just aren't real"* 

And I think this is such a truth. As a woman myself, I often unconsciously and consciously compares myself to other women I see on Instagram or Facebook. Sometimes wish I look like them, wish that I have their waist size, their height...etc.  I remember, I started to notice and feel that way when I was only in 4th grade, that's when Myspace and Facebook were introduced to my life. I look at these altered images and feel bad about myself, I still do. This brings me back to one of the quotes at the beginning of the document that I like 

>*"The process of seeing paintings or seeing anything else is less spontaneous and natural than we tend to believe"*
