# WEEK 1 RESPONSES



## USELESS WEBSITES
When looking at this article many questions arose in my mind. I began to question what the meaning of the title of the article was. How can a website possibly be useless? Even if one person views a website as “useless” another person can view it as useful. 

However, I began to think as if I was in the 1997. I thought differently and saw what this article was referring to. The internet was something that was fairly new and thus nothing was set in stone, in reference to what “defined” the internet. Art was seen as something that did not fit in the structure of what was then considered the internet. Art was something that was traditionally seen as something that was not mostly made of technology. On the internet people started to see that art was something that can be created using only technology. Which lead them to want to explore and branch out from traditional websites and started to make websites consisting of art. It is true that some websites that focused on art were abstract, however that does not automatically make them useless. The internet was something that relied on the content and information to be deemed a website as useful and anything that had no contextual or informational value if the website was something that was useless. Therefore these art websites were considered to be useless in the year 1997. 

Today, I see this as something that has changed a lot. Websites in general are considered works of art in themselves. Each aspect of a website is now considered art. The content and information are important, but just as important is the art aspect of art to the website as a whole. Overall, this is interesting to look at because the way websites are viewed has changed so much in the past 30 years and will continue to change in the years to come. 


## THE HOOVER PROJECT

This was an interesting read because what it was trying to get the reader to envision. It was basically describing a way that people could be monitored and analyzed. And with that information they could be categorized into levels of how violent a person can be. Based on the information collected by the “mobile probe” vast amounts of information can be gathered about one’s private lifestyle. 
	
The reason this one specifically interested me was because it showed how even in 1997 gathering information on users of the internet was something that was already being thought of. Nowadays websites and almost everything on the internet gathers at the very least some of their users information. And in many cases decided to categorize their users into different groups. The general idea of gathering information is still there, however, the way it was gone at was completely different. But it is interesting that an idea from twenty plus years ago is currently being implemented and used by the internet we use today.
