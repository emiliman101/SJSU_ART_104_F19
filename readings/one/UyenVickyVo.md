### By: Benjamin Eakins on Mar 15 1997


Today is my first time going into SWITCH, the interface and the interaction of the website sparks a lot of interests to me. I can tell that it was made along time ago, it IS a website, but for a weird reason, I didn't feel like it was *just* a website. It felt like a historical artsy place that cool artists used to hop on every day. It felt like its value is priceless and the content is so rich and rare that none of the new & modern art journals nowadays doesn't have. It felt organic.  It doesn't feel like going to like medium.com or a news site bbcnews.com. It felt different. 

I landed on the article called "Useless Web Pages" - this title raises many questions in my head. *"How can a web page considered useless?"*, *"What is the definition of useless used in this case"*, *"What are some "useless" website that I know nowadays?"*. The article did help address some of my questions. However, the last one that I mentioned, I  don't know the answer to. Most websites now were *"made for a reason"*, and if it is considered useless to someone, it could be useful for someone else. So how do this works? 

Before reading the article, I had to establish some realization. First, this was written in 1997, almost the same year as I was born. Second, web and IoT were something super new in 1997. I have to be open-minded. 

The article started with Benjamin questioning if these art websites are either Conceptual Folk Art or Post Modern Web Dada. and also mentioned that *"useless web pages vary greatly"*; from games without goals to extremely personal revelations. Useless web pages are considered useless when its information is meaningless. The article mentions how there was no clear line about what is art and what is useless. Benjamin then tried to connect and explain how useless and meaningless goes together. 

> It seems that the "uselessness" of the web pages can be directly corresponded with the meaningless (making no money and achieving no conventional purpose). Some of these useless web pages, fulfilling the characteristics, fit into this accepted art paradigm. The meaninglessness is not only of the work done but also of the information produced. 

> The question arises: while these web pages fit somewhere within existing art paradigms, they are viewed as art neither by the creators, those self-appointed classifiers of the web known as "search engines", or possibly by many who view them and are "entertained" by them.

>Since this work exists within rules for art-making, and has no other clear function besides the entertainment of the creator and the aforementioned social function, it seems to place itself in the "art" category, having no other existing paradigm to fit into. 

My 1997 thought is that since art on the world wide web is such a new thing back then, world wide webs and the internet is not defined yet. While people were still exploring the possible functions of the webs, these "useless" art websites do seem like it doesn't have a place to fit in, therefore; considered useless. Art on the web was a new medium that artists were trying to explore and branch out. I think it makes sense that some of them may be too abstract that they were considered useless. It seems like in 1997, the content and the information on the website were the only things that make it matters to be considered useful. 

My 2019 thought is that most website nowadays is a piece of art. The layout is art, the color is art, the typography is art. They all work together seamlessly. The content and information is important, but also the uniqueness and the art and design that it carries also matters. It is very hard to determine a "useless" website nowadays in my opinion. Again, what doesn't work for you doesn't mean it wouldn't work for me. For example, a website, no context, no text, only has a 3D car model floating around, you play with it, interact with it, and find it entertaining, would that make it useless if it entertains you? What and how do you consider a useless website?
