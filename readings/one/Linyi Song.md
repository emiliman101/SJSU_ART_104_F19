In the article "net_condition" discusses a rather forward-looking exhibition with a profound idea in its core. It depicts the long and challenging relationships between humans and technology as well as the place of the interaction in human life. It is mentioned that the initial idea behind the exhibition was not to respond to the net art trend but to reflect on the digital part of the human life that became rather significant. Hence, the exhibition attempts to reexamine the reach field with all the opportunities, hopes, and, apparently, threats it might imply. 
It is hard to disagree with the objective behind the exhibition as, indeed, nowadays, society has assigned a prominent role to the internet, which cannot be ignored or underestimated. While rather compact, the net has expanded physical borders and reshaped social interaction pattern. Hence, one would agree that it was the utopian features people often assign to the net that should be laid in the essence of artistic investigation. The authenticity of postmodern that can be seen in the idea behind the exhibition allows reexamining the very role of technology advancement in various domains of human lives.  
The interweaving of the real and virtual reflects the modern lifestyle, and it is not surprising that the dynamics were noticed more than twenty years ago and shaped in the form of a museum exhibition. Undoubtedly, art is one of the ways to study and transform modern cybernetic reality into a message that can reach the mind and feelings of the viewer. Nevertheless, despite the innovation, it is not surprising that net art overtook the crisis because, like society, the network continues to develop, and not all the fruits of its development can be grasped sufficiently.
