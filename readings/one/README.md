**Reading One**
======================

We will begin the semester by reading two or three articles from the archives of the SWITCH Journal (http://switch.sjsu.edu/archive/archives/index.html). Look through these archives and think about how technology has changed and advanced over the last 30 years what is different in computation now vs. the mid to late '90s? In what ways has technology and the development of technology not changed? What is the same? Conceptually, what do you think of the articles?

Once you have found and read some interesting articles, post a response of at least 500 words considering the time and the place of these essays. What do you find interesting about what the essays present? Who is the author(s) of the essay that you are commenting on?

Please have your assignment posted to the class git by the **beginning of next class**.
